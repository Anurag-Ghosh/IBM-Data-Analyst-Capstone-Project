# IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project
### Final Project for IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate

#### Description
In this project I will assume that I have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm that is known for their expertise in IT solutions and their team of highly experienced IT consultants. In order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, the organization I am part of regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements.

As a Data Analyst, I would be assisting with this initiative and have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills.

My first task would be to collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources including: Job postings / Training portals / Surveys

Once I have collected enough data, I would begin analyzing the data and identify insights and trends.

For this project, I included the dashboards I built using IBM Cognos Analytics and a presentation using PowerPoint that is based on my analysis of the data that was conducted in previous modules of the course.
